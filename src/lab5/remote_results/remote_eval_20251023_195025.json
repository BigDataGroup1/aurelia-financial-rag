          "definition": "Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed-income security to changes in interest rates, representing the time it takes to recoup the investment in the bond, considering cash flows. It generally indicates the average time until cash flows are received and can be used to compare the interest rate risk of different bonds.",

          "example": "Consider a bond that pays $100 in cash flows for 5 years and then $1,000 at maturity. If the yield to maturity is 5%, the present value of the cash flows would be calculated. The duration can be found by weighting each cash flow by the time until receipt. For example, if the durations of cash flows are taken into account, and after calculation, the overall duration is found to be 4.5 years, this indicates that the bond's price is likely to change approximately 4.5% for a 1% change in interest rates.",
