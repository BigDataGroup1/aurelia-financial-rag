      "definition": "Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed-income investment to changes in interest rates, often used to assess interest rate risk. It reflects the weighted average time until cash flows are received and is essential for bond valuation and portfolio management.",

      "example": "For a bond with cash flows of $100 at the end of year 1, $100 at year 2, and $1000 at year 3, and a discount rate of 10%, the present values are $90.91, $82.64, and $751.31 respectively, giving a total present value (P) of $924.86 and a duration of around 2.43 years.",
