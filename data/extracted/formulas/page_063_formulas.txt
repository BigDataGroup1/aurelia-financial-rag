Formula 1 [simple_equation]:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Settle          = '20-Sep-1999'
Maturity        = '15-Oct-2007'
Period          = 2
Basis           = 0
EndMonthRule    = 1
IssueDate       = NaN
FirstCouponDate = NaN
LastCouponDate  = NaN
Period, Basis, and EndMonthRule are set to their default values, and IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are set to NaN

Single Bond Example
As an example, suppose that you have a bond with these characteristics:
Settle          = '20-Sep-1999'
Maturity        = '15-Oct-2007'
Period          = 2
Basis           = 0
EndMonthRule    = 1
IssueDate       = NaN
FirstCouponDate = NaN
LastCouponDate  = NaN
Period, Basis, and EndMonthRule are set to their default values, and IssueDate,
FirstCouponDate, and LastCouponDate are set to NaN.
Formally, a NaN is an IEEEÂ® arithmetic standard for Not-a-Number and is used to indicate the result
of an undefined operation (for example, zero div

Formula 2 [simple_equation]:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Settle   = '20-Sep-1999'
Maturity = ['15-Oct-2007'

Context:
r some bonds while
explicitly setting nondefault values for the remaining bonds in the portfolio.
Now suppose that you have a portfolio of two bonds.
Settle   = '20-Sep-1999'
Maturity = ['15-Oct-2007'; '15-Oct-2010']
These calls to cfdates all set the coupon period to its default value (Period = 2) for both bonds.

Formula 3 [simple_equation]:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Period = 2) for both bonds

Context:
two bonds.
Settle   = '20-Sep-1999'
Maturity = ['15-Oct-2007'; '15-Oct-2010']
These calls to cfdates all set the coupon period to its default value (Period = 2) for both bonds.
